                                <p>
                                    It was actually fun delving into oneself further at the first module and quite interesting as well.
                                    One gets to know numerous philosophies of historical researchers, philosophers and social scientists
                                    as it gives me some objective guide as to how people work, including myself.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Exhibit A</h3>
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="../img/rational-emp.JPG"/>
                                </figure>
                                <p>
                                    Having this kind of test or assessment made me know about myself that I am quite both the
                                    empiricist and rationalist. It guides me and gives me self-awareness that my decisions are
                                    actually based on this aspect of my personality.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The result of this test actually is what I find true about myself. Because looking back, I 
                                    am kind of adventurous and trying to find out what things, places, and experiences are but also
                                    thinking about the consequences of such through my rational mind. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Maybe, there really is always a part of us that&apos;s empiricist and rationalist but they just vary
                                    in degree in how we decide on things.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Exhibit B</h3>
                                <figure>
                                    <img src="../img/self-factors.jpg"/>
                                </figure>
                                <p>
                                    Knowing about the reasons why I am like this, or what brought me to become what I am by assessing
                                    what has affected me makes me aware of such effects they have about myself. I don&apos;t usually think about
                                    any of these in my spare time and this activity gave me motivation to do so.
                                    <br><br>
                                    What I have learnt in this activity is that generally, my physical body, appearance and functions actually
                                    were inherited by me from my parents. This is due to the genetic code transferred from them to me, making
                                    me look like this now.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Moreover, I have a strong use of my volition in my emotions since I am really behind all of my emotions and 
                                    I could quite say that I have control on them (usually). And lastly, that I rely on others or my environment about
                                    how I connect with it. This is also why I am quite of a mirror to people as how I act around them is usually
                                    how they act towards me.
