                                <h2>
                                    The Spiritual Self
                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    The human spirit is innate in all of us. What&apos;s more is that we have a different and unique soul, or consciousness which makes us
                                    distinguishable from one another. Also, as Michaelangelo has said regarding his sculpture of David, he said that the sculpture is already there
                                    and he just had to etch the bits off of the rock; our soul is comparable to Michaelangelo&apos;s sculpture of David, that our spirit is actually already there, 
                                    and all our decisions, circumstances, and efforts will mold what we will be.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Inner Soul</h3>
                                <p>
                                    My inner soul, intangible but actively there, has been pushing me to my limits for some years to do my best in all things I can. It has been molded
                                    to who I am now but it is still a work in progress indefinitely since I believe there is always room for self improvement. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Anyways, even without my belief in a higher being I still am guided by my morality, soul, and principles that I have imbibed such as
                                    secularism, humanism, and respect for human rights and the environment to name a few. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    
                                </p>
                                <h3>Connection With Nature</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Right now, in the world of technology, our environment and nature has changed and our connection with it has changed also.
                                    We are now in a new Industrial Revolution (4.0) and and are in a highly technofied world and our nature is in danger due to 
                                    the demands of the population. It is not technology that is in itself harmful to environment but our obliviousness to the consequences
                                    of some technologies. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    I myself have been born in an urban environment but nevertheless I still ground myself to nature. As a matter of fact, I have plants in my
                                    room, and yard which I take care of. Anyways, what I think is since our climate problem is brought upon by some technologies, we could solve it 
                                    with technologies too. That&apos;s why I am investing on my studies, and pursuits, to be a nuclear scientist through my program in BS Physics &amp; Electrical Engineering.
                                    Nuclear power has the <i>power</i> to make our carbon footprint lower and become a sustainable society as it only requires a small patch of land,
                                    with high energy output. I have seen firsthand the good and bad side of this technology &mdash; in Philippine Nuclear Research Institute, and in Fukushima respectively
                                    and I have felt a strong connection or attraction with this technology for energy thus I am compelled to use this connection to make our world better.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Life&apos;s Purpose</h3>
                                <p>
                                    What I have learned somehow is that our purpose, in one way or another may change. But it is up to us as to what we
                                    do with our life that can make it purposeful. For me, serving the Filipino people is my objective, and I am aspiring for me to be a future nuclear scientist of the
                                    Filipino people. This is because this journey is hard and not everyone is willing
                                    to stand up to it, and in my thought about this is &quot;if not me, who will?&quot;
                                    <br><br>
                                    Recently, I have met someone who used to be on that path and was almost there up to the point that the nuclear operation of the Philippines 
                                    could&apos;ve started but in a snap, it was gone. It didn&apos;t work out very well for their generation but
                                    I think this time around, hopefully our generation will be more lucky but if that doesn&apos;t work out, 
                                    there&apos;s still a lot more ways for me to do to help the country and humanity even.
