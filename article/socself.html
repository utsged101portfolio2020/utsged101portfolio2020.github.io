                                    The Social Self
                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    Humans as part of society have different roles to play and are given tasks, that are
                                    imbibed in culture, the internet, and through materials and symbolisms. As a part of
                                    this society I have been influenced by it to play a role within it as well. In this page
                                    I will be discussing what influenced me and what I am doing or have done in these aspects.
                                </p>
                                <h3>The Cultural Self</h3>
                                <p>
                                    As a Filipino, we are often not a big player in the world order. That&apos;s because we are a nation
                                    made to believe so as I have believed that way back too. We&apos;ve been colonized thrice for roughly three&dash;and&dash;a&dash;half centuries.
                                    However, as I have been exposed to many opportunities, competing against other countries and meeting awesome
                                    Filipinos along the way, we have really a big potential but sadly, our potentials aren&apos;t supported by the
                                    powers&dash;that&dash;be.
                                    <br><br>
                                    However, as we are going to be part of the nation&apos;s future our generation is pushing for more 
                                    inclusivity, peace, and equity. I am hopeful for our culture as Filipinos
                                     to change for the better as our generation shows promise and hope.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Socio-Digital Self</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Being born in this generation and context, having a socio-digital
                                    personality and involvement in the cyberspace is already the norm.
                                    Much more in this setting that we are now in a digital class setting.
                                    <br><br>
                                    What I can really say about myself regarding my use in the cyberspace is 
                                    I am really wack in such a way that I am really particular into memes
                                    and making music parodies just like what I did in other projects.
                                    <br><br>
                                    From time to time, I also engage in my nuclear advocacies in the internet as
                                    as cyberactivism to call out the incompetence of the government due to the lives that are
                                    at stake.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Also, I use the cyberspace as a learning resource, other than 
                                    it being the venue of our online classes by reading posts made by real people
                                    regarding social issues, trends, etc giving me awareness about them and internet culture. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>The Material Self</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Also, born into an Ilokano household, I am accustomed to being &quot;kuripot&quot;
                                    being a stereotype of being Ilokano. Although not to an extreme extent, being accustomed
                                    to using and buying only what is needed is actually helpful for us as it gives us
                                    a modest lifestyle but enough in times of emergencies.
                                </p>
