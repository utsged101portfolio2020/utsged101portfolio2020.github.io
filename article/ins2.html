                                </h2>
                                <p>
                                    Module 2 opened up an avenue for brainstorming as we were given the chance to collaborate in a presentation. We
                                    learned many things from our peers who reported as well as within the team.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Particularly, The Dimensions of the Self were discussed in those reports and more ideas came to me. Regarding the reports of our biological self,
                                    mental, emotional, learning, political, and even digital selves were discussed and intertwined into what is us. Our morals, 
                                    principles, and even health rely on these dimensions. It is very crucial for these reports to show how we should handle these 
                                    dimensions to remain healthy in those aspects. From Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, to Active Citizenship, these are all guides
                                    for us to be a better person and have a more effective, healthy dimensions of the self.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Moreover, the after-reporting discussions really gauge our critical thinking into the reports. Our group actually had a question in mind regarding the 
                                    report that tackled on Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory specifically in the aspect self-efficacy but it was cut off short due to time constraints. However it goes
                                    like this&colon; why is it that even with verbal persuasion there are people who have a way of having &quot;reverse psychology&quot; where even with a positive persuasion, some self-efficacy weaken or the other way around.
                                    Like, for example, we can often hear from successful people that they&apos;ve been turned down quite several times, or even insulted and in turn, negatively persuaded but
                                    still did the other way and persevered?
                                    <br><br>
                                    Anyways, the course module really imparted to us information and guidance to become a better, more
                                    well-rounded individual and personally, it has made me more aware about my different aspects of the self.
